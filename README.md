# **Handwritten Digit Recognition**  

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**  
This project implements **Handwritten Digit Recognition** using **Machine Learning and Deep Learning models**. It classifies digits (0-9) based on pixel intensity values. The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle**, and various classifiers like **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and CNN** are used.  

---

## **ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description**  
The dataset consists of grayscale images of hand-drawn digits (0-9).  

- **Dataset**: [MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data)  
- **Format**: CSV files (`train.csv` and `test.csv`)  
- **Image Size**: `28x28` pixels (total `784` pixels)  
- **Pixel Values**:  
  - Each pixel has an intensity value from **0 (white)** to **255 (black)**  
  - Higher numbers indicate **darker pixels**  

### **ðŸ”¹ Training Data (`train.csv`)**
- **785 columns**  
  - **First column (`label`)**: The digit (0-9)  
  - **Remaining 784 columns**: Pixel intensity values  

Each pixel column is named **pixelX**, where `X` represents the pixel position in a **28x28 matrix**.  
For example, `pixel31` represents the **4th column** and **2nd row** in the image.  

**Visual Representation of Pixel Indexing:**  
```
000 001 002 003 ... 026 027
028 029 030 031 ... 054 055
056 057 058 059 ... 082 083
  |   |   |   |  ...  |   |
728 729 730 731 ... 754 755
756 757 758 759 ... 782 783
```

### **ðŸ”¹ Test Data (`test.csv`)**
- **784 columns** (No `label` column)  
- The test file contains **28,000 images**, and we need to predict their labels.

## **ðŸ“Œ Machine Learning Models Used**  

### **ðŸ”¹ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- A simple and effective model that classifies digits based on the majority vote of its nearest neighbors.  
- **Pros**: Works well for small datasets, easy to implement.  
- **Cons**: Slow for large datasets as it requires storing all training samples.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Decision Tree**  
- A tree-based model that makes decisions by recursively splitting the data.  
- **Pros**: Easy to interpret, requires minimal data preprocessing.  
- **Cons**: Prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Random Forest**  
- An ensemble learning technique that combines multiple Decision Trees to improve accuracy.  
- **Pros**: Reduces overfitting, provides higher accuracy.  
- **Cons**: Computationally expensive compared to a single Decision Tree.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- A powerful classification model that finds an optimal hyperplane to separate data points.  
- **Pros**: Works well for high-dimensional data and small datasets.  
- **Cons**: Computationally expensive, requires careful tuning of parameters.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**  
- A deep learning model specifically designed for image recognition tasks.  
- **Pros**: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in digit recognition, automatically extracts important features.  
- **Cons**: Requires significant computational power and a large dataset for training.

## **ðŸ“Œ Hyperparameter Optimization**  
Hyperparameters control how a model learns. Finding optimal hyperparameters **improves accuracy** and prevents overfitting.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Types of Hyperparameters**  
- **K (KNN):** Number of neighbors to consider.  
- **Max depth (Decision Tree):** Limits tree growth to prevent overfitting.  
- **Number of estimators (Random Forest):** Number of decision trees in the forest.  
- **Kernel (SVM):** Defines the transformation of input space.  
- **Learning rate (CNN):** Controls model weight updates.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Hyperparameter Tuning with Random Search**  
Random Search randomly selects hyperparameters from a predefined set.  

#### **Implementation (Example for Decision Tree):**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'criterion': ['gini', 'entropy'],
    'max_depth': [10, 20, None],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
}

random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(DecisionTreeClassifier(), param_distributions=param_grid, n_iter=10, cv=5)
random_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Best Parameters:", random_search.best_params_)
```
âœ… **Finds best hyperparameters automatically**  
âœ… **Reduces overfitting**
